### What is a computer?
**Informally:**
- A computer is a device that processes information by executing sequences of instructions

**Formally:**
- A general-purpose computer must be equivalent in capability to a UTM (assume infinite storage)
- Conditional branching
- Ability to change arbitrary memory locations

### Storing information in bits
**bit** - binary digit
- represent elementary states in binary system

To go from number of states to number of bits required use log2
